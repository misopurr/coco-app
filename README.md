# Coco AI - Connect & Collaborate

**Tagline**: _"Coco AI - search, connect, collaborate – all in one place."_

Coco AI is a unified search platform that connects all your enterprise applications and data—Google Workspace, Dropbox,
Confluent Wiki, GitHub, and more—into a single, powerful search interface. This repository contains the **Coco App**,
built for both **desktop and mobile**. The app allows users to search and interact with their enterprise data across
platforms.

In addition, Coco offers a **Gen-AI Chat for Teams**—imagine **ChatGPT** but tailored to your team’s unique knowledge
and internal resources. Coco enhances collaboration by making information instantly accessible and providing AI-driven
insights based on your enterprise's specific data.

> **Note**: Backend services, including data indexing and search functionality, are handled in a
> separate [repository](https://github.com/infinilabs/coco-server).
